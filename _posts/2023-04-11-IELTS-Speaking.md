# 别人的好消息

**PART2: Describe a time when you heard good news about someone you know well**
**You should say:**
**Who the person is**
**What the good news was**
**When and how you heard the good news**
**And explain how you felt when you heard the good news about this person.**



In my second year of college, I had a close friend named Li Hua. We shared a lot of common interests and spent a lot of time studying and hanging out together. Li Hua was an incredibly hard-working and ambitious student who aspired to study abroad for his Master's degree. He had a dream of attending a top-tier university in the United States to pursue his passion for computer science.

The good news came one day in late March. We were having lunch together in the university cafeteria when Li Hua excitedly shared that he had received an acceptance letter from MIT – one of the world's most prestigious institutions for computer science. This was a fantastic achievement, given the intense competition for admission to such a renowned school.

When Li Hua told me the news, I was absolutely **thrilled for** him. I knew how much time and effort he had put into his application, from preparing for the TOEFL and GRE exams to polishing his personal statement and collecting recommendation letters. Seeing his dedication finally pay off was incredibly satisfying.

I felt **a mix of emotions** when I heard the good news about Li Hua. On one hand, I was **overjoyed** and proud of my friend for achieving his dream. On the other hand, I also felt a little sad, knowing that he would be leaving for the United States in a few months and that our friendship would inevitably change as we pursued different paths. Nonetheless, I was confident that Li Hua would make the most of this incredible opportunity and that we would remain close friends despite the distance.

In conclusion, hearing the good news about Li Hua's acceptance to MIT was a memorable moment in my college life. I was **elated** to see my friend's hard work and dedication pay off, even though I knew that we would soon be separated by thousands of miles. The experience taught me the importance of celebrating our friends' successes and cherishing the time we have together.





**Part 3 : ls it good to share something on social media?**

Sharing information on social media has its advantages and disadvantages, and the impact of doing so largely depends on the content being shared and the intention behind it.

On the positive side, sharing information on social media platforms can foster connections, promote awareness, and provide support. By sharing personal experiences, achievements, and interests, individuals can connect with others who have similar backgrounds or hobbies. This sense of community can be beneficial in combating feelings of isolation, especially in an increasingly digital world.

Furthermore, social media allows users to disseminate important information quickly, which can be invaluable during times of crisis or when raising awareness about significant issues. For instance, social media played a pivotal role in spreading news and coordinating relief efforts during natural disasters or in advocating for social justice causes.

However, there are also notable drawbacks to sharing information on social media. Sharing personal information indiscriminately can lead to privacy concerns and, in some cases, even jeopardize personal safety. In addition, the constant pursuit of validation through likes and comments may contribute to a culture of comparison and superficiality, which can negatively impact mental health.

Moreover, the rapid dissemination of information on social media often leads to the spread of misinformation or so-called "fake news." This can have serious consequences for individuals and society as a whole, as inaccurate information can shape public opinion and influence decision-making.

In conclusion, whether sharing information on social media is good or not depends on various factors, including the nature of the content, the intentions of the user, and the potential impact on others. While social media can serve as a powerful tool for connection and advocacy, it is essential for users to exercise discretion and critical thinking when engaging with these platforms. By doing so, we can maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages.



---

Sharing content on social media can be both beneficial and harmful, depending on the context and intent behind it. In this answer, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of sharing on social media and provide a balanced conclusion.

On one hand, sharing information on social media platforms can be an effective way to disseminate important news, raise awareness about various issues, or simply stay connected with friends and family. For instance, during natural disasters or humanitarian crises, social media can be a valuable tool for disseminating vital information, mobilizing resources, and providing support to affected communities. Additionally, social media enables individuals to share their experiences and perspectives, fostering open dialogue and promoting cultural understanding.

Moreover, sharing content on social media can be a powerful means of self-expression and creativity. Users can showcase their talents, engage with like-minded individuals, and even build professional networks that lead to career opportunities. In this sense, sharing on social media can have a profoundly positive impact on personal growth and development.

On the other hand, there are significant concerns related to privacy, mental health, and the potential for misinformation when sharing on social media. Personal information, images, and opinions can be misused or taken out of context, leading to harassment or negative consequences in one's professional life. Additionally, the pressure to maintain an idealized online persona can lead to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and depression.

Furthermore, the spread of false information and "fake news" on social media platforms is a significant issue, contributing to social and political polarization. The rapid dissemination of unverified information can lead to misguided beliefs, unwarranted fears, or even dangerous behaviors.

In conclusion, while sharing content on social media can have numerous positive outcomes, such as fostering connections, promoting awareness, and providing opportunities for self-expression, it is essential to consider the potential risks and negative consequences. Users should exercise discretion and responsibility when sharing on social media, taking care to respect privacy, maintain authenticity, and verify the accuracy of information. In doing so, we can harness the power of social media for positive change while mitigating its potential harms.

**Should the media only publish good news?**

The question of whether the media should only publish good news is a matter of debate, as it touches on the role of media in society, journalistic ethics, and public interest. In this answer, I will discuss the arguments for and against exclusively publishing good news and provide a balanced conclusion.

Advocates of publishing only good news argue that it can promote positivity and uplift the public's mood. In a world where negative events often dominate headlines, focusing on the positive aspects of life can contribute to a more optimistic and hopeful outlook. Proponents of this view believe that good news can inspire people to take positive actions, foster a sense of community, and improve mental well-being.

However, there are several compelling arguments against exclusively publishing good news. Firstly, the primary responsibility of the media is to inform the public about the events that shape our world, regardless of whether they are positive or negative. Journalists have a duty to report on a wide range of issues, including those that are challenging or uncomfortable, in order to provide an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the world.

Secondly, limiting media coverage to good news could result in a lack of awareness about critical issues that require public attention, debate, and action. The media plays a vital role in holding governments, corporations, and individuals accountable for their actions, and addressing societal problems depends on having an informed and engaged citizenry. Ignoring or downplaying negative news may hinder the public's ability to make informed decisions and contribute to positive change.

Lastly, a focus on only good news can give a distorted view of reality, leading to complacency and indifference. A balanced media landscape that reflects the complexity and diversity of human experience is essential for fostering critical thinking and empathy.

In conclusion, while the publication of good news has its merits in promoting positivity and inspiration, it is crucial for the media to maintain a balance between positive and negative news coverage. An exclusive focus on good news would undermine the media's primary responsibility to inform the public and could result in a lack of awareness and engagement with critical issues. By striving for balanced and accurate reporting, the media can fulfill its essential role in fostering an informed and responsible society.

**How does the social media help people access information?**



Social media has revolutionized the way people access information in the modern era, providing a variety of channels for individuals to stay informed and engaged with the world around them. In this answer, I will discuss the various ways in which social media helps people access information and the implications of this shift in information consumption.

Firstly, social media platforms have made it easier for users to access **real-time updates on current events**, news, and trends. Traditional media sources, such as newspapers and television, may not **provide the same immediacy** as social media, where users can receive updates instantly through their feeds or notifications. This instant access to information allows individuals to stay informed about the latest developments in their areas of interest, **fostering a sense of connection and engagement** with the world.

Secondly, social media enables users to **access diverse perspectives and opinions**, as it provides a platform for **individuals from all walks of life** to share their views and experiences. This diversity of voices can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of complex issues, encouraging critical thinking and fostering empathy for different perspectives. Moreover, social media algorithms often **tailor content** based on users' preferences and interests, making it easier for individuals to discover information that **aligns with their personal values and passions**.

Another significant way that social media helps people access information is by **enabling the dissemination of grassroots and citizen journalism**. In instances where mainstream media coverage may be limited, social media platforms allow individuals to report on events and share information directly with the public. This can lead to **increased transparency and accountability**, as well as **providing alternative narratives and insights** that might otherwise be overlooked.

However, the ease with which information can be accessed and shared on social media also raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and "fake news." Users must **be vigilant in** verifying the **credibility of the sources** they encounter and should be cautious of the potential for echo chambers, where they are only exposed to information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs.

In conclusion, social media has significantly transformed how people access information, offering real-time updates, diverse perspectives, and a platform for citizen journalism. While there are concerns about **the spread of misinformation**, social media's ability to connect individuals with information that is relevant and engaging has undoubtedly expanded our understanding of the world and **facilitated a more informed and engaged public**.

Another type of good news that people often share revolves around acts of kindness, generosity, and heroism. Stories of individuals going above and beyond to help others, such as volunteering, donating to a worthy cause, or rescuing someone in need, can be uplifting and inspiring. These stories not only showcase the best of human nature but also encourage others to engage in similar acts of kindness, fostering a more compassionate and supportive community.

Lastly, breakthroughs and advancements in various fields, such as science, technology, and medicine, are also widely shared as good news. Examples include the development of a new vaccine, the discovery of a novel treatment for a disease, or the launch of an innovative product. Sharing such news highlights the progress being made in society and can generate a sense of optimism and hope for the future.

In conclusion, the types of good news that people often share within communities include personal achievements, collective successes, acts of kindness, and societal advancements. These stories serve to uplift, inspire, and strengthen bonds between community members, fostering a more supportive and connected environment. By sharing good news, individuals can contribute to a positive atmosphere that encourages growth, collaboration, and compassion.

Generally, people enjoy hearing good news from their friends, as it provides an opportunity to share in their happiness, celebrate their successes, and reinforce the bonds of friendship.

One primary reason people like to hear good news from their friends is that **it fosters a sense of connection and empathy**.

Furthermore, hearing good news from friends can have a positive impact on **one's own emotional well-being**.

Lastly, sharing and hearing good news **within a circle of friends** can create a positive feedback loop, encouraging all members to focus on the positive aspects of life and celebrate each other's achievements.

# 广告

**Describe an advertisement you have seen that you did not like.**
**You should say:**
**Where and when you saw this advertisement**
**What the it was for**
**What you could see in the advertisement**
**And explain why you did not like it.**



I remember an advertisement I saw in China about six months ago, which **left a negative impression on me**. It was a billboard near a busy subway station in Shanghai that I passed by every day on my way to work. The advertisement was for a new **weight loss supplement.**

The ad featured a before-and-after picture of a young woman who had **supposedly** used the product. In the "before" image, she appeared slightly overweight, wearing plain clothes, and looking unhappy. In the "after" photo, she was **portrayed as** slim, stylish, and smiling brightly. The ad claimed that the weight loss supplement could help users lose a significant amount of weight within a short period, and the tagline read, "Transform your life with our miracle pill!"

There were several reasons why I did not like this advertisement. First, I believe it **promoted an unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standard**. By using the woman's transformed appearance to sell the product, the ad suggested that only slim people could be stylish and happy, **reinforcing the harmful stereotype** that one's self-worth is **tied to their physical appearance**.

Second, the ad made unrealistic and potentially dangerous promises about the effectiveness of the supplement. Promoting rapid weight loss can be harmful, as it encourages people to **resort to extreme measures**, which can lead to various health issues. Moreover, the ad did not mention any possible **side effects of the produc**t, which I found concerning.

Lastly, I disliked the advertisement because it **preyed on the insecurities** of its target audience. By **using emotionally manipulative tactics**, such as the "before" and "after" images and the tagline, the ad aimed to **create a sense of urgency and exploit** the vulnerabilities of those who might be struggling with their self-image.

In conclusion, the weight loss supplement advertisement that I saw in Shanghai did not sit well with me because it promoted unhealthy beauty standards, made unrealistic promises, and exploited the insecurities of its target audience. I believe that ads should be more responsible and considerate of the messages they convey to the public.

**Is it a good idea to use famous people in advertisements？**



The use of famous people in advertisements has both advantages and disadvantages, and whether it is a good idea depends on the context and goals of the advertising campaign.

On the positive side, using famous people in advertisements can:

1. Attract attention: Celebrities often have a large fan base and widespread recognition, which can help an advertisement stand out and draw viewers' attention. This increased visibility can lead to a greater awareness of the product or service being advertised.
2. Build credibility and trust: Associating a well-respected celebrity with a brand or product can lend credibility and trust to the advertisement. Consumers may be more likely to believe the claims made in the ad or trust the quality of the product if a respected figure endorses it.
3. Influence consumer behavior: Celebrities often have a significant influence on their fans, who may be more likely to purchase a product or service endorsed by their favorite celebrity. This can lead to increased sales and brand loyalty.
4. Create an aspirational image: A celebrity's success, talent, or physical attractiveness can be associated with the advertised product, creating an aspirational image that encourages consumers to believe that using the product will help them achieve similar success or qualities.

However, using famous people in advertisements also has some drawbacks:

1. High cost: Hiring a celebrity to endorse a product can be very expensive, and smaller companies may not have the budget to afford such advertising campaigns.
2. Short-lived impact: The effectiveness of celebrity endorsements can be short-lived, as public opinion of a celebrity can change rapidly due to scandals, controversies, or shifting tastes. This can lead to an advertisement losing its appeal or even causing harm to the brand.
3. Overshadowing the product: In some cases, the celebrity's fame may overshadow the product itself, leading to a situation where viewers remember the celebrity but not the product being advertised.
4. Lack of authenticity: If the celebrity endorsing the product is not perceived as a genuine user or a credible expert in the related field, the advertisement may be seen as inauthentic and could even lead to consumer skepticism or backlash.

In conclusion, using famous people in advertisements can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the context and the specific goals of the campaign. It is crucial for advertisers to carefully consider the potential advantages and drawbacks before deciding whether to use a celebrity in their advertisements.



Utilizing famous people in advertisements can be **an effective marketing strategy**, but its success depends on various factors, including the target audience, the **celebrity's public image**, and the relevance of the celebrity to the product or service being advertised. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using celebrities in advertisements.

Advantages:

1. Instant recognition and credibility: Celebrities often have **a large fan base** and are easily recognizable, which can **grab the attention** of potential customers quickly. Their **endorsement of a product or service** can lend credibility and trustworthiness to the brand, making it more appealing to consumers.
2. Influence: Celebrities can have a significant influence on their fans, who may be more inclined to purchase a product or service if their favorite celebrity is endorsing it. This can lead to increased sales and brand awareness.
3. Emotional appeal: Celebrity endorsements can **evoke an emotional response** from potential customers, who may associate the product or service with the qualities and values of the celebrity. This emotional connection can lead to a stronger brand loyalty and a positive brand image.

Disadvantages:

1. High cost: Hiring a celebrity for an advertisement campaign can be expensive. The **potential return on investment** must be carefully considered to ensure that the benefits of using a celebrity endorsement **outweigh the costs**.
2. Overexposure: Some celebrities appear in multiple advertisements for different brands, which can **dilute their credibility and influence**. Consumers may become skeptical of the celebrity's endorsement if they are seen promoting numerous products or services.
3. Risk of negative publicity: Celebrities are often **under public scrutiny**, and any **negative news or scandals** can **reflect poorly on the brands they endorse**. Associating a brand with a celebrity who becomes involved in a controversy can damage the brand's reputation and lead to a loss of customers.

In conclusion, using famous people in advertisements can be a successful marketing strategy, but it is essential to carefully consider the specific celebrity and the context in which they are being used. Brands should weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages before deciding to use a celebrity endorsement in their advertising campaigns.

**Which one is more effective, print advertising and online advertising?**



Both print and online advertising have their unique advantages and effectiveness, but in today's **fast-paced digital era**, I believe that online advertising tends to be more effective for several reasons.

Firstly, online advertising **allows for** **better targeting of potential customers**. Through the use of algorithms and data analysis, businesses can **direct their advertisements to a specific demographic**, ensuring that they **reach the most relevant audience**. This level of personalization is not possible with print advertising, which usually targets a broader audience and may not be as effective **in capturing the attention** of potential customers.

Secondly, online advertising is more cost-effective compared to print advertising. The production and distribution of print advertisements can be expensive, especially if they are placed in **high-circulation newspapers** or magazines. In contrast, online advertising platforms often offer flexible pricing options, allowing businesses to set their own budgets and easily adjust their advertising strategies based on performance.

Moreover, the **interactive nature of online advertising** provides an opportunity for businesses to engage with their customers more effectively. Online advertisements can include links, videos, or even interactive elements, which can be more **appealing and engaging** compared to static print advertisements. This increased engagement can lead to higher conversion rates and ultimately more sales for the business.

Finally, online advertising allows businesses to **track the performance of their ads in real-time**. Through various analytic tools, advertisers can measure key performance indicators, such as impressions, clicks, and conversions, and make data-driven decisions to optimize their campaigns. This level of insight is generally not available in print advertising, making it difficult to measure the return on investment.

In conclusion, while print advertising still has its merits, online advertising is generally more effective in today's digital landscape due to its targeting capabilities, cost-effectiveness, interactivity, and the ability to track and optimize performance.

**Is it important to educate young people about the dangers of advertising?**



Yes, it is crucial to educate young people about the dangers of advertising. Advertising is everywhere, from social media and television to billboards and magazines, and it can have a significant impact on how young people **perceive themselves**, their peers, and the world around them.

One of the primary dangers of advertising is that it often promotes unrealistic and unhealthy beauty standards. Young people, particularly girls, are bombarded with images of thin, conventionally attractive models and celebrities, which can lead to **body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and eating disorders**.

Additionally, advertising often **perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes**, such as the idea that girls should be nurturing and emotional while boys should be strong and **stoic**. These stereotypes can limit young people's potential and negatively impact their mental health and relationships.

Furthermore, many advertisements use **persuasive tactics**, such as emotional appeals and celebrity endorsements, to convince young people to buy products or engage in certain behaviors. This can be particularly dangerous when it comes to products that may be harmful or addictive, such as tobacco, alcohol, or sugary foods.

By educating young people about the dangers of advertising, we can help them develop critical thinking skills and **empower them to make informed decisions**. They can learn to recognize manipulative advertising tactics, question beauty standards and gender stereotypes, and understand the potential consequences of their actions.

In conclusion, educating young people about the dangers of advertising is crucial for their mental and physical well-being, as well as their ability to navigate the complex world of media and marketing.

# 不寻常的一顿饭

**You should say:**
**When you had this meal**

**Where you had this meal**
**And explain what was unusual about this meal**

Thank you for the opportunity to describe an unusual meal I had. It happened last December when I went out with three of my closest friends to celebrate the end of the year. We decided to try a new restaurant called "Out of the Ordinary," located in a trendy neighborhood and known for its innovative dishes.

The meal was unusual because of the unique combination of ingredients and the **peculiar presentation**. We had a five-course tasting menu, starting with a vibrant salad made of **edible flowers** and microgreens with a **fruit-infused vinaigrette**. The flavors were intense and the colors were striking.

The main course was a deconstructed sushi platter, allowing us to create our own combinations of fish, rice, and vegetables. The dish was **not only visually appealing but also interactive and fun**.

Dessert was the highlight of the meal, as it was a **molecular gastronomy creation**. We were served a raspberry sorbet encapsulated in white chocolate, resembling a poached egg. Breaking the shell revealed the sorbet, mimicking a runny egg yolk, which amazed all of us.

In summary, this unusual meal was a delightful mix of unexpected flavors, textures, and presentations, making it a memorable dining experience that I will cherish for a long time.

**How popular is fast food in your country?**



Fast food has become increasingly popular in China over the past few decades due to **rapid urbanization, economic growth, and the influence of Western culture**. This popularity can be attributed to several factors, including **convenience, affordability, and the appeal of Western brands**.

However, it is essential to note that while fast food has **gained popularity** in China, traditional Chinese food culture remains deeply rooted and influential. Many people continue to appreciate and enjoy regional cuisines and home-cooked meals, often favoring them over fast food options.

In conclusion, fast food has indeed become popular in China due to the convenience, affordability, and influence of Western brands. However, this trend coexists with the strong and enduring appreciation for traditional Chinese food, which remains an integral part of the country's culinary landscape.

**What are the most popular and least popular apps in China?**



In China, there is **a wide variety of apps** that **cater to** different needs and preferences. The popularity of these apps can **be attributed to** various factors, such as their functionality, user experience, and **relevance to the local market**. In my opinion, some of the most popular apps in China include WeChat, Alipay, and Douyin, while the least popular apps might be those **with limited functionality or poor user experience**.

WeChat, developed by Tencent, is perhaps the most popular app in China. It is a **multi-purpose platform** that allows users to send messages, **make voice and video calls**, **share moments with friends**, and even make payments. WeChat's **immense popularity** can be attributed to its **versatility** and the fact that it **caters to almost every aspect of daily life**, making it an **indispensable tool** for many Chinese users.

Alipay, on the other hand, is a widely-used **mobile payment app** developed by Alibaba Group. It has transformed the way people **make transactions** in China, offering a convenient and secure method to **pay for goods and services** both online and offline. **With its broad range of features**, such as bill payments, money transfers, and even investments, Alipay has become a **crucial financial tool** for millions of users in the country.

Another popular app is Douyin, which is known as TikTok in international markets. Douyin is a short-video sharing platform that allows users to create and share creative content, often set to music. The app has gained widespread popularity due to its user-friendly interface, engaging content, and the opportunity it provides for users to **express themselves and connect with others**.

In contrast, the least popular apps in China are likely those that **have limited functionality** or **fail to *address* specific needs of the local market**.

**What's the difference between the Internet and television?**



The Internet and television are two **distinct** media platforms that serve different purposes and have unique characteristics. While both provide information, entertainment, and communication, they differ in several key aspects, such as **interactivity**, **content diversity**, **accessibility**, and **user control.**

One of the primary differences between the Internet and television **lies in their level of interactivity**. The Internet is an interactive platform that allows users to **actively engage with content**, search for information, and communicate with others in real-time. Users can post comments, share opinions, and **contribute to discussions** on various topics. In contrast, television is a **passive medium** where users watch **pre-determined content** with limited opportunities for interaction.

Content diversity is another significant difference between the two platforms. The Internet **offers a vast array of content** across **numerous genres and formats**, catering to different interests and preferences. Users can access news, blogs, videos, podcasts, and social media platforms, **all tailored to their specific interests**. Television, on the other hand, provides a more limited range of content, mainly through scheduled programming and channels. While there is still diversity in television content, it is comparatively more restricted than the Internet.

Accessibility is another crucial factor that **sets the two platforms apart**. The Internet is accessible 24/7 through various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, allowing users to access content **whenever and wherever they choose**. Television, in contrast, **has** traditionally been accessible through a dedicated device and **relies on** scheduled programming, which means users must **adhere to specific timings** to watch their desired content. Although streaming services and digital video recorders have increased the flexibility of television viewing, it still **lacks the on-demand nature of the Internet.**

Lastly, user control is a distinguishing feature between the Internet and television. With the Internet, users have **the autonomy to choose** what they want to consume, when, and **at what pace**. They can easily navigate between different websites, platforms, and content, allowing for a highly personalized experience. Television, however, offers less control, as users must rely on the programming and scheduling decisions made by broadcasters and networks.

In conclusion, the Internet and television **differ in** their levels of interactivity, content diversity, accessibility, and user control. While both platforms **serve as sources of** information and entertainment, the Internet offers greater flexibility, personalization, and interactivity, whereas television is a more passive and structured medium.

Additionally, the Internet provides access to a wide variety of news sources, both local and international, which allows users to explore different perspectives and viewpoints. This diverse range of sources enables people to **make more informed decisions** and develop a deeper understanding of global events. In contrast, TV news broadcasts are often limited to a few major networks, which may not **offer the same level of diversity in reporting**.

Lastly, the interactive nature of the Internet allows users to fact-check, discuss, and **engage with the news content in real-time**. Through social media platforms, forums, and comment sections, people can share their opinions, debate, and **collaborate in the analysis of news events**. This level of engagement is not possible with TV news, as it is a passive medium with limited opportunities for interaction.

In conclusion, people prefer to read the news on the Internet instead of on TV because it offers greater convenience, personalization, access to a variety of sources, and the ability to engage with the content. These advantages make the Internet a more appealing and effective platform for staying informed about current events and global developments.

Libraries provide a platform for people to connect with others, share ideas, and **engage in lifelong learning**, which is essential for **personal growth and social cohesion**.

In addition to these social and educational functions, libraries **play a crucial role** in preserving valuable resources. Libraries **house** rare books, historical documents, and other materials that may not be available digitally or easily accessible online. These resources are essential for researchers, historians, and anyone interested in studying our cultural and **intellectual heritage**.

Finally, libraries are staffed by trained professionals who offer personalized assistance and guidance. Librarians can help users locate and navigate resources, provide research assistance, and recommend materials based on individual interests and needs. This level of personalized support is **not easily replicated** by digital platforms or search engines.

In conclusion, libraries remain necessary in today's digital age due to their role in promoting equal access to information, providing a physical space for learning and collaboration, fostering community engagement, preserving valuable resources, and offering personalized assistance. Libraries continue to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of their communities, ensuring their ongoing relevance and importance in society.

After the presentation, I was filled with mixed emotions. On one hand, I was relieved that our group had managed to complete the presentation without major issues. On the other hand, I felt guilty and embarrassed for **causing inconvenience** to my teammates and **disrupting the flow of the presentation**. This experience taught me the importance of time management, punctuality, and taking responsibility for my actions. I have since been more **diligent in setting alarms** and ensuring I arrive on time, if not early, for important events.

Secondly, liking classmates can have a positive impact on academic performance. Studies have shown that students who have strong social connections and feel accepted by their peers are more likely to be engaged and motivated in their studies. They are more inclined to participate in class discussions, ask for help when needed, and take on leadership roles in group projects. These positive social experiences can lead to increased confidence, self-esteem, and resilience, all of which contribute to better academic outcomes.

Lastly, it is important for school children to like their classmates to **promote emotional well-being**. Having friends and feeling connected to a social group is a fundamental human need. When children feel liked and accepted by their classmates, they **experience a sense of belonging and security,** which contributes to their overall happiness and mental health. Positive peer relationships can also **act as a buffer against stress**, providing emotional support during challenging times.

However, it is important to note that it is not necessary for children to like **every single one of their classmates**, as it is natural to have preferences and **form closer bonds with certain individuals**. What is crucial is **fostering a general sense of respect, empathy, and understanding among classmates**, which will **create an environment conducive to learning and personal growth**.

In conclusion, it is essential for school children to like their classmates, as it plays a significant role in creating a healthy learning environment, enhancing academic performance, and promoting emotional well-being. Encouraging positive relationships among students should be a priority for educators and parents alike, as it contributes to a more fulfilling and successful educational experience.

**What makes someone a good colleague?**



A good colleague **possesses a combination of qualities and traits** that contribute to a harmonious and productive work environment. I would like to focus on five main characteristics: professionalism, communication, teamwork, adaptability, and supportiveness.

Firstly, professionalism is a crucial attribute of a good colleague. This encompasses elements such as punctuality, reliability, and a strong work ethic. A professional colleague consistently meets deadlines, takes their responsibilities seriously, and maintains a high standard of work. This level of dedication and commitment contributes to the overall success of the team and fosters trust among colleagues.

Clear and open communication helps to avoid misunderstandings, **ensures smooth collaboration**, and enables efficient problem-solving. A good colleague is not only an attentive listener but also articulates their thoughts and ideas constructively, fostering an atmosphere of transparency and open dialogue.

Thirdly, a good colleague understands the importance of teamwork and collaboration. They recognize that each team member brings unique strengths and perspectives to the table and are willing to delegate tasks and share responsibilities accordingly. This involves being cooperative, respectful, and valuing the input of others. A good colleague is not only focused on their own success but also strives to achieve collective goals and contribute positively to the team.

Fourthly, adaptability is a valuable quality in a good colleague. In today's rapidly changing work environment, colleagues need to be flexible and responsive to shifting demands and circumstances. A good colleague is open to new ideas, embraces change, and is willing to learn and grow. This adaptability not only enhances their own performance but also supports the team in navigating challenges and embracing opportunities.

Finally, a good colleague is supportive and empathetic, both professionally and personally. They are sensitive to the needs of their coworkers and are willing to offer help, advice, and encouragement when needed. This sense of supportiveness extends beyond work-related matters and includes showing genuine care and concern for the well-being of their colleagues.

In conclusion, a good colleague is characterized by a blend of professionalism, effective communication, teamwork, adaptability, and supportiveness. These qualities not only contribute to a positive and harmonious work environment but also enhance the overall success and well-being of the team. Encouraging and fostering these attributes in the workplace should be a priority for both employers and employees alike.

**Is it the most important to have good colleagues in a job?**

While having good colleagues in a job is certainly important and beneficial, it may not be the most important aspect for everyone. The significance of good colleagues can vary depending on individual priorities, career goals, and personal circumstances. I would like to discuss three aspects to consider when determining the importance of good colleagues: job satisfaction, personal growth, and work-life balance.

Firstly, job satisfaction is a crucial factor in evaluating the importance of good colleagues. For many individuals, positive and supportive relationships with colleagues can significantly enhance their overall job satisfaction. A harmonious work environment fosters collaboration, reduces conflicts, and contributes to a sense of belonging, which can positively impact employee morale and motivation. However, job satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept, and other factors, such as job security, compensation, and opportunities for advancement, can also play a significant role in determining an individual's satisfaction with their job.

Secondly, personal growth and career development are other aspects to consider. Good colleagues can contribute to an individual's growth by sharing knowledge, providing constructive feedback, and offering new perspectives. They can also help expand one's professional network, opening up opportunities for career advancement. However, some individuals may prioritize other factors, such as the nature of their job, opportunities for further education, or the reputation of the company, when considering their personal growth and career progression.

Lastly, work-life balance is an essential element in evaluating the importance of good colleagues. For some individuals, having good colleagues can help create a supportive and understanding work environment, making it easier to maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life. However, other factors, such as workload, job flexibility, and company culture, can also have a significant impact on one's ability to achieve a satisfactory work-life balance.

In conclusion, while having good colleagues can undoubtedly contribute to a positive work experience, the importance of this factor can vary depending on individual priorities and circumstances. Job satisfaction, personal growth, and work-life balance are all aspects to consider when determining the significance of good colleagues in a job. Ultimately, each individual must weigh the importance of good colleagues against other factors to determine what is most important to them in their career.

# 家里舒服的地方

**Describe the part of your home where you most enjoy relaxing.**
**You should say:**
**What part of your home this is**
**When you usually relax there**
**How you relax there**
**And explain why you find this part of your home a good place to relax in.**



I would like to describe my favorite spot in my home for relaxation - the cozy reading nook situated in the corner of my living room. This space is both inviting and comfortable, making it the perfect place to unwind and recharge after a long day.

I usually relax in this part of my home in the evenings or on weekends when I have some free time. After finishing my **daily chores** or work-related tasks, I look forward to spending some quiet moments in my reading nook, as it offers me a **peaceful sanctuary** **away from the *hustle and bustle*** of everyday life.

To relax in my reading nook, I typically settle into the **plush armchair** that occupies the space, which is **accompanied by a soft, warm blanket and a few decorative cushions**. A small side table stands next to the chair, providing a convenient spot for a cup of tea or coffee. I often spend my time in this nook reading a captivating novel or **catching up on my favorite magazines**. Additionally, I sometimes use this space for meditation or simply to listen to **soothing music** or an engaging podcast.

There are several reasons why I find this part of my home to be the ideal place for relaxation. Firstly, the reading nook is situated next to a large window, which **allows plenty of natural light to stream in** during the day, creating **a serene and calming atmosphere.** The window also offers a beautiful view of the garden, providing me with **a connection to nature** and **a sense of tranquility**.

Secondly, the reading nook is separate from the main living area, offering **a degree of privacy and quietness** that I truly appreciate. This separation allows me to **escape from distractions** and **fully immerse myself in my chosen activity**, whether it be reading or meditation.

**Why is it difficult for some people to relax?**

There are various factors that can make it difficult for some people to relax, and these factors can be broadly categorized into internal and external influences. I would like to discuss four primary reasons: **stress and anxiety**, **personal habits**, **environmental factors**, and **societal pressures**.

Firstly, stress and anxiety can significantly **hinder an individual's ability to relax**. When someone is constantly **worried or preoccupied with their personal or professional concerns**, it can be challenging for them to **switch off their thoughts** and **enter a state of relaxation**. Anxiety can ***manifest* as an overactive mind** or **a sense of restlessness**, which makes it difficult for the person to **unwind and enjoy moments of tranquility**.

Secondly, personal habits and lifestyle choices can also play a role in an individual's ability to relax. Some people have a tendency to over-commit or engage in excessive multitasking, leaving little time for relaxation and self-care. Additionally, habits such as excessive caffeine consumption, lack of physical exercise, or irregular sleep patterns can disrupt the body's natural relaxation response and make it more challenging to find moments of calm and reprieve.

Environmental factors are another reason why some people might find it difficult to relax. **A noisy, cluttered, or chaotic living environment** can make it challenging for an individual to find a peaceful space where they can unwind. Furthermore, **constant exposure to technology**, such as smartphones, laptops, and television, can **exacerbate feelings of restlessness and overstimulation**, as the constant barrage of information and notifications can make it difficult for the mind to settle and relax.

Lastly, societal pressures and expectations can also contribute to the difficulty some people face when trying to relax. In today's fast-paced, competitive world, many individuals feel pressured to constantly be productive and efficient, leading to a sense of guilt or unease when attempting to engage in relaxation or leisure activities. This perceived need to always be 'on' can make it challenging for people to allow themselves the time and space needed to truly unwind.

In conclusion, several factors can make it difficult for some people to relax, including stress and anxiety, personal habits, environmental factors, and societal pressures. To foster a greater sense of relaxation and well-being, it is essential for individuals to recognize and address these barriers, finding ways to create balance and prioritize self-care in their daily lives.

**Do you think many people today are too self-centred?**

While it is difficult to generalize the behavior of **a large and diverse population**, it is true that some people today may appear more self-centered due to certain societal and cultural factors. However, it is important to recognize that there are also many individuals who are compassionate, empathetic, and community-oriented. The following points shed light on some factors that might contribute to the perception of increased self-centeredness in today's society:

1. The rise of individualism: In many cultures, individualism is highly valued, and people are encouraged to **prioritize personal goals and achievements**. This focus on individual success can sometimes lead to a perception of self-centeredness, as people become more concerned with their own well-being and aspirations.
2. Social media influence: The widespread use of social media platforms can contribute to the perception of self-centeredness. People often use these platforms to showcase their lives and accomplishments, creating a culture that revolves around self-promotion and self-expression. This can sometimes result in a heightened focus on oneself, potentially leading to self-centered behavior.
3. Consumerism and materialism: Modern society is characterized by a strong emphasis on consumerism and materialism. People are often encouraged to acquire more possessions and strive for greater wealth, which can lead to a focus on personal gain and a perceived lack of concern for others.
4. Fast-paced lifestyle: The rapid pace of modern life can also contribute to an increased focus on oneself. People are constantly juggling multiple responsibilities, such as work, family, and personal commitments, leaving little time for reflection or consideration of the needs of others.

Despite these factors, it is essential to recognize that many people still prioritize empathy, compassion, and community involvement. There are numerous examples of individuals and organizations working tirelessly to make a positive impact on their communities and the world at large. It is important to acknowledge this diversity of perspectives and actions and avoid overgeneralizing the behavior of the entire population.

In conclusion, while certain factors in today's society may contribute to the perception of increased self-centeredness, it is crucial to recognize that there are many people who are deeply committed to the well-being of others and their communities. It is important to focus on promoting empathy, compassion, and cooperation to create a more inclusive and caring society.

# 帮助亲人朋友

**Describe a time when you were teaching a friend or a relative to do something.**
**You should say:**
**Who you taught**
**What you taught him/her to do**
**How easy it was to teach him/her**
**And explain how you felt about teaching this friend/relative.**

In my response to this IELTS speaking test question, I would like to recount a memorable experience when I taught my mother how to use a mobile application. My mother, who has always been quite traditional and somewhat hesitant to embrace new technology, showed a sudden interest in using a mobile application for communication and organization purposes. The app I introduced her to was called "WhatsApp," a widely popular instant messaging platform that is user-friendly and provides various features, such as voice and video calls, sending documents, and creating groups.

Although my mother had never used such an application before, she was motivated to learn and stay connected with her friends and family members more efficiently. Before we started, I made sure to explain the basic functions of her smartphone and the fundamentals of using apps, which laid a solid foundation for our learning process.

To my surprise, teaching my mother how to use WhatsApp was easier than I had anticipated. She was a quick learner and was able to grasp the concepts quite well. I started by demonstrating how to add contacts, send text messages, and make voice calls. We then moved on to more advanced features, like sharing media files, creating groups, and customizing her privacy settings. Throughout the process, I maintained a patient and supportive attitude, which I believe was crucial to her successful learning experience.

Overall, I felt a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in teaching my mother how to use the WhatsApp application. Not only did it strengthen our bond, but it also empowered her to embrace the digital age and enhance her communication with loved ones. Furthermore, the experience taught me the importance of patience and effective communication in the process of teaching. I am proud of my mother's progress and am always eager to assist her in exploring new applications and digital tools.

# 开学第一天

**Describe something you remember about your first day at a new school.**
**You should say:**
**Where the school was**
**What you remember well**
**How you felt about your first day at the school**
**And explain why you remember this about your first day at the new school.**

On my first day of high school, I found myself in a school located in the ancient district of the city, right beside a river that flowed through the heart of the town. The picturesque surroundings were enchanting, and the school was only a 15-minute bike ride from my home. Additionally, it was in close proximity to my middle school, which added a sense of familiarity to the new experience.

As I entered the classroom and watched my classmates arrive one by one, I was delighted to discover that one of my closest friends from middle school was also in the same class. This unexpected reunion brought me immense joy and relief, as I knew that I would have a trusted companion by my side during this new academic journey. Furthermore, I found our teachers to be incredibly approachable and amiable, which further contributed to the positive atmosphere in the classroom.

On that first day, I felt a mix of emotions. I was understandably nervous about the new environment and the academic challenges that high school would bring, but the presence of my close friend and the kind teachers made me feel more at ease. I also experienced excitement and anticipation, as I looked forward to exploring new subjects and participating in various extracurricular activities offered by the school.

The reason why this day stands out in my memory is because it marked the beginning of a significant chapter in my life. It was a day filled with newfound hope, camaraderie, and reassurance. The beautiful surroundings, the support of my friend, and the warmth of the teachers created an environment that fostered personal and academic growth. This unforgettable experience taught me the value of friendship, adaptability, and resilience, and has had a lasting impact on my outlook and approach towards life's challenges.

I would like to share my experience of the first day at a new school, which still remains vivid in my memory. This school, which I joined when I was 13 years old, was located in a serene suburban area, surrounded by lush greenery and well-manicured lawns. The campus had a picturesque setting, which was a stark contrast to my previous school that was situated in the heart of the city.

What I remember distinctly about my first day at this new school is the warm welcome I received from both the staff and my fellow students. Upon entering the school premises, I was greeted by the principal, who took the time to personally introduce me to my new teachers and classmates. This kind gesture made me feel valued and eased my nerves. Another memorable aspect of that day was the school's impressive library, boasting an extensive collection of books and resources that immediately piqued my curiosity.

Naturally, I felt a mixture of anxiety and excitement on my first day. The prospect of making new friends and adapting to a different environment was intimidating, but at the same time, I was eager to embrace the new opportunities that lay ahead. The friendly atmosphere and the supportive attitude of the people around me helped in alleviating my initial apprehensions.

The reason I remember this particular day so vividly is that it marked the beginning of a transformative period in my life. My first day at the new school set the tone for my entire academic journey there, fostering a positive environment that nurtured my intellectual and personal growth. The warm reception I received on that day served as a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy and kindness, which has stayed with me ever since. Ultimately, this experience has left an indelible mark on my character and continues to shape the person I am today.

# 难用的科技产品

**Describe a piece of technology that you find difficult to use.**
**You should say:**
**What you use it for**
**When you got it**
**How often you need to use it**
**And explain why you find this piece of technology difficult to use.**

I would like to talk about my struggles with using a smart home device called a voice assistant. Specifically, I own an Amazon Echo Dot, which I received as a gift from a friend last year. The primary function of the device is to respond to voice commands and perform various tasks, such as playing music, setting reminders, and controlling other smart devices in my home.

Although the concept of voice assistants is becoming increasingly prevalent, I find it challenging to use this particular technology effectively. One reason for this is the device's sensitivity to background noise and environmental factors. For example, when I try to give a voice command, the device may not always understand me correctly if there is noise from other people or appliances in the room. This often leads to frustrating experiences, where I need to repeat my commands multiple times or adjust my pronunciation to be understood by the device.

Another challenge I face with the voice assistant is the limited range of functions and commands that it can perform. While the device has various skills and features, it may not always be compatible with the other devices or systems in my home. This can make it difficult to use the device to its full potential or integrate it into my daily routine seamlessly.

Despite these challenges, I recognize the potential benefits of using a voice assistant in terms of convenience and efficiency. I believe that as the technology continues to improve, and more features become available, the voice assistant will become a more valuable tool for my daily life. In the meantime, I will continue to experiment with different ways of using the device, and work on improving my communication skills with the voice assistant.

I would like to describe a piece of technology that I find quite challenging to use: a digital drawing tablet. This tablet is designed for creating digital illustrations, graphic designs, and animations, and it's a tool commonly used by artists and designers to bring their creative ideas to life. I acquired the drawing tablet about a year ago as a gift, with the hope of improving my digital art skills and expanding my creative horizons.

I use the drawing tablet sporadically, typically when I have some free time or when I feel inspired to create digital artwork. As a hobbyist, I do not need to use it as frequently as a professional artist would; however, I do make an effort to practice and become more proficient in using the tablet.

The primary reason I find this piece of technology difficult to use is the steep learning curve associated with transitioning from traditional pen-and-paper drawing to a digital medium. With the drawing tablet, I need to look at the computer screen while drawing on the tablet surface, which can be quite disorienting initially. The absence of a direct visual feedback on the tablet surface adds to the complexity of using the device.

Another challenge I face while using the drawing tablet is mastering the various software programs required for creating digital art. These programs often have numerous features and tools that can be overwhelming for a beginner. Additionally, the pressure sensitivity and responsiveness of the stylus can be difficult to adjust to, as they require a different level of control and precision compared to traditional drawing tools.

Despite these challenges, I am determined to improve my proficiency with the drawing tablet, as I believe it is a powerful tool that can help me unlock new creative possibilities. My struggles with the tablet serve as a reminder that learning new technologies often requires patience, perseverance, and an open mind, and that these qualities are essential for growth and adaptation in our rapidly evolving digital world.

One activity that I really enjoyed doing in my free time when I was younger was playing basketball with my friends. We would usually play at the local park, which had a basketball court that was easily accessible for us. It was a great way to stay active and improve our basketball skills while having fun with our friends.

I would typically play basketball with a group of 4-5 friends, who were all around the same age as me. We would play pick-up games or shoot around, practicing different moves and techniques. We all shared a common love for the game, and it was a way for us to **bond over our mutual interest**.

I enjoyed playing basketball because it was a physically challenging sport that **required both skill and teamwork.** It was a great way to **stay in shape** and improve my athletic abilities, as well as learn important life lessons such as **perseverance and resilience**. Additionally, basketball helped me to build friendships and connect with other people who shared my passion for the sport.

Looking back, I realize that basketball **played an important role in shaping who I am today**.

One place that I visited recently which was very noisy was a bustling outdoor vegetable market in the heart of the city. The market was located in a densely populated area, and it was a popular destination for locals to purchase fresh produce, seafood, and meats. As soon as I entered the market, I was immediately struck by the cacophony of sounds that surrounded me.

The market was crowded with people jostling for space, and the vendors were shouting out their prices and offerings to attract customers. Additionally, the market was situated in close proximity to a busy road, and the honking of cars and motorbikes added to the overall noise level.

The reason why the market was so noisy was due to the volume of people and the high demand for fresh produce. The vendors were all competing with one another to sell their goods, which led to an increase in the volume of their voices. Additionally, the market was located in a densely populated area, and the constant flow of people in and out of the market contributed to the overall noise level.

While the noise level at the market was high, I appreciated the vibrant and lively atmosphere that it created. The energy and vitality of the market were contagious, and I felt a sense of excitement and joy as I wandered through the stalls. The noise level was an indication of the popularity and success of the market, and it added to the overall experience of being there. However, I also appreciated the moments of respite, where I could step away from the noise and crowds and find a quieter spot to catch my breath. Overall, the experience of visiting the noisy vegetable market was a memorable one, and I was grateful for the opportunity to witness such a lively and dynamic aspect of the local culture.

One thing that I had to share with others was my laptop during my university years.

However, during my first semester, my laptop broke down unexpectedly and I couldn't afford to purchase a new one right away.

Fortunately, I had a group of supportive classmates who were willing to share their laptops with me. I remember feeling embarrassed and anxious about having to ask for help, but my classmates were incredibly kind and understanding. They offered to let me borrow their laptops during class and even outside of class, so that I could complete my work on time.

What I learned from this experience is that sharing can be a powerful way to build community and to support each other during difficult times. It taught me the importance of asking for help when I need it, and it showed me how powerful kindness and generosity can be. Overall, while sharing my classmates' laptops was initially a challenge, it ultimately brought me closer to my peers and helped me to succeed academically.
