When I was a child, I used to play a game called "Hide and Seek" with my friends. It was a simple game that involved one person being "it" and counting to a designated number while the other players hid. The "it" player then had to find and tag the other players before they could reach the base or home without being caught.

I played the game with my friends after school and during weekends in our neighborhood park. We would spend hours playing the game, coming up with new hiding spots and strategies to avoid being caught. It was a great way to get some exercise and have fun with my friends.

I played the game with my childhood friends, who were my neighbors and classmates. We would often play in large groups, with everyone trying to outdo each other in terms of creativity and skill.

I loved playing "Hide and Seek" as a child because it was a game that required both physical and mental skills. I enjoyed the adrenaline rush of hiding and trying not to get caught, as well as the satisfaction of successfully evading the "it" player. It was also a great way to bond with my friends and develop teamwork skills.

Looking back, playing "Hide and Seek" was one of the highlights of my childhood. It was a game that brought me joy, excitement, and a sense of camaraderie with my friends. Even though I don't play the game anymore, I still have fond memories of the times I spent playing it as a child.
